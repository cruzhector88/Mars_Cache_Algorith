This was a project given to me on the class of Computer Architecture.
The goal of the project is to simulate a cache using the programming language MIPS Assembly
using different algorithms. We know that cache makes the computer work faster by saving data
we use frequently to save time when we open a program or web page again. But, because the cache
memory is limited it uses algorithms to predict which data to keep and which to replace. Some
algorithms are better than other but the ones I was task to do were the set-associative cache
and the optimun cache. Apart from that we were given a bonus if the project was optimized or 
in other words faster than the others.
